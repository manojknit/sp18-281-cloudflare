#### MongoDB research:

  - #### Introduction:

  - MongoDB is a document oriented NoSQL database and cross-platform that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. 	
  - MongoDB uniquely allows users to mix and match multiple storage engines within a single deployment.	
  - Traditionally, multiple database technologies would need to be managed to meet these needs, with complex, custom integration code to move data between the technologies, and to ensure consistent, secure access.
  - Collections in mongodb are analogous to a table in a relational database: documents are similar to rows, and fields are similar to columns.

  - #### Advantages:

  - MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. 	
  - The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with.
  - Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data.  
  - MongoDB is free and open-source, published under the GNU Affero General Public License
