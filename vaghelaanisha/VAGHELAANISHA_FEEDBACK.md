## Feedback
Every iteration commitment is taken seriously by delivering a working software. The software is delivered early to the customer and a feedback is taken so that necessary changes can be made if needed. Concrete feedback about the current state of the system is priceless. The value of the feedback is a continuously running system that delivers information about itself in a reliable way.

In Extreme Programming, feedback is ensured at all levels at different time scales âˆ’

+ Customers tell the developers what features they are interested in so that the developers can focus only on those features.
+ Unit tests tell the developers the status of the system.
+ The system and the code provides feedback on the state of development to the managers, stakeholders and the customers.
+ Frequent releases enable the customer to perform acceptance tests and provide feedback and developers to work based on that feedback.
+ When the customers write new features/user stories, the developers estimate the time required to deliver the changes, to set the expectations with the customer and managers.

## Week 1
+ Adviced my team to do proper research on all the aspects of the project so that we can work accordingly.
+ This research would help us to work efficiently and estimate time required for development.

## Week 2
+ Discussed with the team the work done last week and how to improve upon that this week.
+ Discussed and analysed different scenarios and use cases that can be used in the project.

## Week 2
+ Discussed about the progress in last week and analysed where can the team optimize and improve.
+ Discussed about the integration of the work done by the team.
