## Eliminate Waste
"Waste is the result of activities or environmental conditions that prevent a team from reaching its goal. The opposite of waste is something that adds value (more, faster or higher quality) to the desired result."[1]

## Week 1
+ Helped the team members to focus on tasks at hand which are easily understood, rather than going too far into something which is yet unknown (known concepts like aws, docker,go vs little known like CAP properties etc).
+ This helped us in coming up with a proper basic plan which can be enforced next week. Otherwise, less focussed discussion would have increased the meeting time and wastage of important time was reduced.

## Week 2
+ Helped the team to come up with a project architecture so as to reduce waste in remembering ambiguous details about the architecture. 
+ This will help the team to focus on the overall system, rather than just single component. Also, helps the team realise the part of their component in the architecture

## Week 3
+ We decided and came up with an final architecture for our application and I helped the team decide on the parts necessary. This made the scope of project very specific, instead of having lot of haphazard modules.

## Week 4
+ Helped the team decide on what modules to build and test first. This helped us to set a priority list so that major tasks are completed on time and time is left for proper integration.
