## Communication

"Communication is a value necessary for the success of an Agile team, but that can be overlooked by most programmers coming from some backgrounds, such as freelancing. The constant rethinking of how to communicate more and with fewer costs is part of the costs of scale that a team encounters whenever it has more than 1 member"
