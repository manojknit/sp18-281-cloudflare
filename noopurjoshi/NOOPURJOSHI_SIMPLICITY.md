## Simplicity
+ We will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. 
+ This will maximize the value created for the investment made to date. 
+ We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. 
+ We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs. 


## Week 1
+ We decided to divide responsibilities according to the functionality and create a simple modular structure.

## Week 2
+ Modularized the project by dividing each functionality into independent modules to simplify the project structure.

## Week 3
+ Added five ec2 nodes for storing module specific data using mongodb.
+ Simplified the creation of nodes by creating a base image and using that to create all the other nodes.

## Week 4
+ Simplified the basic architecture of the project by adding types/ structs in go.

## Week 5
+ Simplified integration testing by defining test scenarios before hand.
