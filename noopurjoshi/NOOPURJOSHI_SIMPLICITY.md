## Simplicity
+ We will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. 
+ This will maximize the value created for the investment made to date. 
+ We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. 
+ We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs. 


## Week 1
+ We decided to divide responsibilities according to the functionality and create a simple modular structure.
